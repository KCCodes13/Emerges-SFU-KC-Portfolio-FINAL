                <h1>Background</h1>
                <br><br>
                <p>KC Johan graduated from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 2017 with a Bachelor's in
                    Sociology (Emphasis in Culture & Communications). In 2016, she worked her first marketing internship
                    where she learned about social media marketing, lead generating, and being a Brand Ambassador. After
                    graduating in San Diego, she pursued her marketing career. Along the
                    way, she also did other works, temping for front desk positions which built her administrative
                    skills over the years. She made her way along in the industry, working positions as a Social Media
                    Assistant and an Account Coordinator, and developed an interest in blogging, SEO Marketing, and
                    social media marketing.
                    <br><br>

                    More recently, in 2021, she completed a Marketing Assistant internship where she learned many
                    valuable skills in WordPress, blog writing, SEO and Google Ads and Asana.
                    After her internship ended, she now works as a Project Assistant part-time while also pursuing her
                    certifications in Digital Marketing, UI / UX Design and Web Development
                    as well as completing materials for her project portfolio.
                    <br><br>
                    When she isn't pursuing her career, KC enjoys traveling, photography, cooking, watching movies, and
                    learning new things online.
                    <br><br>
